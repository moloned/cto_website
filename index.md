## Why

I decided to try this after reading [Jeremy Howard's blog post]  (https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/)

[My blog is now accessible on] (https://moloned.github.io/cto_maverick/)

The only issue not codered in Jeremy's blog entry was that you need to set the Github Pages section of the settings menu for your blog repo to Master otherwise the blog isn't accessible and you get a 404 error

## How
